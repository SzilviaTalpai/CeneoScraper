Perfect even for people who don't know how to cook. Thanks to built-in recipes, it guides you step by step through the subsequent stages of cooking. Easy to clean. I recommend.",

There are many more recipes on the Internet on the mc website than those programmed on the device - much needs improvement.",

        "content": "We were very disappointed with this device in terms of functionality. The essence of the device is access to recipes and ease of their implementation. Unfortunately, the phone app is a complete disaster... a non-intuitive, jamming mess that pretends to be an app. Saving recipes, adding shopping lists and searching do not work. There are only a few recipes loaded on the device and others do not load despite being connected to the Internet. I finally managed to add a recipe to my favorites on the recipe website, but it did not appear on the device. This is its biggest disadvantage. Technically, the device's touch display works at the speed of a turtle, it is probably taken from the first touch phones where you had to use a hammer to press something. 4 hours after receiving the shipment with the robot, we decided to return it.\nIf you are interested in entering recipes manually and having a terrible connection to the application (or rather no connection), I recommend this purchase!",
